## Week_5_challenge

1. ### **<font color = 'blue'>Combine and Clean the Data</font>**
   **In this section the files are imported into dataframes which then are explored, to identify data types
   possible null values and summary statistics to gain better overall understanding of each file.
   Later on the files are combined into one with the <font color = 'grey'>'Concat'</font> function. The combined files are
   explored and the features a cast accordingly to late aid in further analysis. It is worth noting that the 'invoice_date'
   feature was cast as 'datetime' with the rest of the variables which needed re-casting.**

2. ### **<font color = 'blue'>Determine which Region Sold the Most Products</font>**
3. ### **<font color = 'blue'>Determine which Region had the Most Sales</font>**
4. ### **<font color = 'blue'>Determine which Retailer had the Most SalesÂ¶</font>**
   **In this sections we attempt to extract actionable information by narrowing the scope of our analysis
     as the titles indicate .To perform this tasks the'groupby' method and the 'pivot_table' fucntion are used.**
   
5. ### **<font color = 'blue'>Determine which Retailer Sold the Most Women's Athletic Footwear</font>**
   **This sections drills down even further by narrowing the scope to a type of product <font color = 'grey'>'Women's Athletic Footwear'</font>,
   again 'groupby'and pivot_table' are utilized**

6. ### **<font color = 'blue'>Determine the Day with the Most Women's Athletic Footwear Sales</font>**
7. ### **<font color = 'blue'>Determine the Week with the Most Women's Athletic Footwear Sales</font>**
   **In the efforts to provide greater specificity in our insights in sections 6 and 7 a time frame is added dayli and weekly respectively.
     The overall trend of this analysis is from general to specific from location,to product, to time frame, in this final part the 'resample'
     method was used.<br>**
   **Its worth noting the discrepancy in the instructions between the bootcamp module and the notebook rubric, in the bootcamp module for sections 6 & 7
     the tables are in descending order and in the rubric in ascending order, for the sake of completeness we have provided both.**
